"DEA" means Directed Edge Adjacency matrix, another name for the Non-backtracking matrix.
We also have used other names for the matrix, like "DOG", which stands for
"Directions Of Graph" and "cavity matrix". So don't be surprise if you see "DOG" or
"cavity" in the code.

1.) "mode" has a new defualt option 5, which uses B', the 2N*2N matrix instead of DEA matrix.
2.) MATLAB version tolerence has been added to random number generator.
3.) a bug in demo demo_eigenvalues_DEA.m has been fixed, that is: numvec -> opt.numvec.
